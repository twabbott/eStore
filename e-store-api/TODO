high priority:
*   Actually try to run this using the student registration db
*   Get ES6 imports working.  Using require() everywhere is LAME!!

Bugs (blocking/critical):
    (none)

It would be nice:
*   If there was some server-side rendering to show a list of tables on the 
    welcome page.
*   If on startup, the output

Issues (there is a work-around):
*   When you call dumpAllTables, make it back up the previous versions.
    *   Never got backup to work for dumpAllTables.  Looks like when you 
        require() a file, node keeps a lock on it or something.

*   We now have a generic repo layer!
    *   Now to add a table all you have to do is modify ./repositories/index.js
    *   You still need to add a service layer to enforce schema and other 
        constraints.
    *   PROBLEM: The dumpAllTables function won't back up the previous version.
        It seems to just make two copies of the same file.
